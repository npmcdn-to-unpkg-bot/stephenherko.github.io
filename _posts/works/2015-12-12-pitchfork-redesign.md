description: "Music has always been a major passion of mine, so I decided to redesign one of my favorite sites. I felt it needed to become responsive and focus on usability. The current site is very closed in, which can appear small on modern screen sizes. I wanted to make the navigation more noticeable, and easier to use. Another major goal of the redesign was to give it more of a modern vibe pushing the music/artists up front."
