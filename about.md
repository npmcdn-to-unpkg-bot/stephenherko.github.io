##Hello, my name is Stephen

I'm currently working as the creative director for PVP Live. I'm interested in skill sets like Branding, Front End Development, and Design. I love helping brands reach and develop their voice. Coming up with solutions to problems, and using strategic actions to provide the best end product.
