  <h1>Hello, <br />my name is Stephen</h1>

  <p>I've been working professionally for the last 10 years. My background began in advertising where I developed print and marketing campaigns. From there I fell in love with design and branding. It seems to take up most of my time and thoughts these days. </p>

  <p>Originally from the Philadelphia area, now residing in Texas. I'm always looking for challenges and self improvment. Two things I believe are essential to any creative's career.</p>

  <p>I'm currently working as the creative director for PVP Live. I'm interested in skill sets like Branding, Front End Development, UI/UX Design, as well as a little marketing sprinkled on top. I love helping brands reach and develop their voice.</p>
